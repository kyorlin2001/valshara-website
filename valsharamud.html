	<h2>Valshara Mud</h2>
	<h3>Update 8/6/2019 - New beginnings</h3>
	<article><p>Valshara Mud is currently in development.  Many pieces were lost over there years and there are multiple incompatibilities with modern operating systems.  The mud will undergo a complete rewrite prior to its reopening.  Also I plan to create several improvements to the mud output to help with assistive technologies in both PC and mobile clients.  Updates will be placed here as soon as there is significant progress.</p><p>As the mud nears completion, this page will contain information and help files as well as maps for the game.  For now however it will mainly have updates of the progress on the mud code.</p></article>
